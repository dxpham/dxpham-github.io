			<p style="width:65%; margin-top: -35px">I have a Ph.D. in mathematics with a minor in scientific computing from Indiana University under supervision of <a href="http://pages.iu.edu/~temam/">Roger Temam</a>. 
						</p>
				
			<p> I have been in academic after graduation in 2007 to now, which you can refer my work at <a href="http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~ryp927">my academic webpage</a>. I became more and more interested in 
			data science and machine learning in the past few years and here is a few of my programming work that I am proud of:

							<h3>&#9755; Machine Learning from Titanic Disaster</h3>
							<p>I participated in a binary classification project for the Titanic disaster on Kaggle. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.</p>
							<p>In the challenge, I was asked to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, I was asked to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
								</p>
							<p>Based on the given train and test data, which were excel data files with  many missed entries, I did some data wrangling  using Panda. 
								I was then able to predict the survivals at an acuracy of 82.3% using a three-layer neural network on Kaggle and at 85.4% using train/test data. My result using neural network performs better than the traditional statistical methods (decision tree, logistic regression, ...) which could get to  78% even for this not so large size data set.</p>

					<h3>&#9755; 2D Lid Driven Fluid Flow</h3>
					<p >In this project we solve the Navier Stokes equations on a rectangular domain: we seek numerical solution of the velocity of a fluid flow body \(\mathbf{u} =(u,v)\) and its the pressure \(p\)
						satisfying 

					 
										\[\begin{cases} & \mathbf{u}_t -\frac{1}{Re}\triangle \mathbf{u} +\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} + \nabla  p = {\bf 0}, \\ & \nabla\cdot \mathbf{u} = 0,
										\\ &  \text{Boundary + initial conditions}.
										\end{cases} \]
							 The flow vanishes on the boundaries except at the top boundary where the horizontal velocity is one \(u=1,v=0\):

					<p>Given \(\mathbf{u}^n\), we find \(\mathbf{u}^{n+1}\) using projection fractional step method:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Step 1: find \(\mathbf{u}^{n+\frac 12}\) solving 
							\[\frac{\mathbf{u}^{n+\frac 12} - \mathbf{u}^n}{\triangle t} -\frac{1}{Re} \triangle \mathbf{u}^n + \mathbf{u}^n \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u}^n =\mathbf{0}. \]
						</li>
						<li>Step 2: find \(\mathbf{u}^{n+1}\) from 
								\[ \frac{\mathbf{u}^{n+1} - \mathbf{u}^{n+\frac12}}{\triangle t} =  \nabla p^{n+1},\]
								which we first find \(p^{n+1}\) by projecting the equation on the divergence free space: \[\triangle p^{n+1} = \frac{1}{\triangle t } \nabla\cdot \textbf{u}^{n+\frac12}.\] 
						   </li>
					</ul>

					<p>I implement this method projection in time combined with finite difference in space using Fortran. Please look at  <a href="https://github.com/dxpham">My Github Profile</a> for the implemetation in Fortran, which you should be familiar with the make file and Gnuplot.</p>
